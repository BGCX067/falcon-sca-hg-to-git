This project uses maven from dependency control.

To setup or upgrade the appengine environment, run mvn gae:unpack

Maven should work with your favorite IDE with the correct plugin.

To run the project locally run mvn appengine:devserver (or mvn clean appengine:devserver).

After running the first time, or after a clean, access the pages (in order).
