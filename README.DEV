This project uses maven from dependency control.

To setup or upgrade the appengine environment, run mvn gae:unpack

Maven should work with your favorite IDE with the correct plugin.

To run the project locally run mvn gae:run (or mvn clean gae:run).

After running the first time, or after a clean, access the pages (in order).

If you are having problems with the service freezing when loading the default page, load http://localhost:8080/RehydrateDatabase.groovy
